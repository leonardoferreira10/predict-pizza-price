## Introduction

"Pizza Price Predict" was developed as an initial project to learn how to create and test Machine Learning models using real-world data. The project covers everything from data collection and preparation to model creation and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Main programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive environment for experimentation.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualisation)

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pizza-price-predict.git
   cd pizza-price-predict

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  # Activation on Linux/Mac:
  source venv/bin/activate
  # Activation on Windows:
